Design ideas

* Dual panes like Norton Commander
* Each pane is a WAD directory viewer but also a file browser.
  Opening a WAD is a matter of browsing to a .wad and hitting enter
* Default view is left: IWAD; right: cwd
* Different F-commands appear on bottom line of screen depending.
  (* means "only works for single lump)

      Single-lump case:          Multi-lump/file case:
* WAD / dir:
  - WAD side:
    - Left|Right (swap)          *                                 F2
    - Hexdump                    *                                 Alt-F3
    - View (Export>temp, open)   Export & open multiple            F3, Ent
    - Edit                       ? Could be: apply to multiple     F4, Alt-E
    - Export [format] (to dir)   Export multiple [format]s         F5
    - Export LMP (to dir)        Export multiple LMPs to dir       Alt-F5?
    - Rename                     ? Could be: regex rename          F6, Alt-R
    - New (empty?) lump?         *                                 F7, Ins
    - Delete                     Delete multiple LMPs              F8, Del
    - Make WAD                   New WAD containing selected lumps F9

== Old NWT commands

View Hex Dump
 - Ideally should be a full hex editor but whatever
Export RAW
 - WAD - Export LMP > Directory
Export GIF/WAV
 - WAD - Export [format] > Directory
Export >PWAD
 - WAD - Copy > WAD
 - NWT command generates a new WAD. Maybe we can just have a command that
 - makes a new empty WAD?
Import RAW >IWAD
 - Directory - Import > WAD
Show/play resource
 - Transparently export GIF/WAV/MIDI/etc. and xdg-open
 - On DOS it needs an actual viewer. Separate program?
Import RAW >PWAD
 - Convert .lmp to .wad
Import GIF/WAV > IWAD
 - Directory - Import [format] > WAD
Import GIF/WAV > PWAD
 - Convert .gif/.wav/.mid to .wad
Import GIF/WAV > RAW
 - ?
Edit Resource
 - Change field properties of graphic lumps. Generalize?
Rename Resource
 - Rename command
Textures
 - Browse to TEXTUREn lump and open like a directory
PNAMES
 - Browse to PNAMES lump and open like a directory
Setup
 - Needed?
Load WAD
 - Browse to .wad file and open
DOS Shell
 - Needed? Under DOS I guess

==

Generic decode for different lump types:

* All level lump types
* MIDI / MUS
* Graphic
* TEXTURE
* PNAMES
* Sound effect
* PC speaker effect
* PLAYPAL
* COLORMAP
* DEMO

Convert to Yocton format and back again, with basic editor in program

== Interpretations of import

When importing a resource into a WAD it could mean one of:

* Copy contents of file into WAD as a lump
* Convert contents of file (eg. GIF, PNG, WAV) and put in WAD as lump

Also, when importing we can do:

I1. Create new lumps, insert at WAD cursor position
  - Advantage of being simple and easy to comprehend. "Take the thing from over
    there are put it over there".
  - Workable: to update a lump you import the new lump and delete the old one
  - Could have an action that deletes duplicates
  - Allows for the "rename lump after import" case
I2. Overwrite content of selected lump
  - Somewhat easy to comprehend
  - Does not scale to multiple lumps. Could be a good approach for single lumps
    but might be confusing to have the behavior for single/multiple differ
I3. Update lumps by name
  - Look for existing lumps with names that match the filename. We overwrite
    the existing lump contents with new contents, possibly prompting for
    confirmation from user first.
  - Somewhat complicated. There is not the visual confirmation of things being
    updated. Perhaps some kind of highlight could be used to show things that
    have been updated recently.

Added complexity:
C1. When importing a level we should usually treat the level as a whole, not
    just a bag of unrelated lumps
  - But sometimes maybe we do want to think about individual lumps?
C2. Sprites should be enclosedin SS_START..END, flats in FF_START..END etc.

Use cases:

U1. Making a new WAD. I first create an empty WAD and then want to import some
    things into the WAD. Maybe from an existing WAD or from files.
U2. I am iteratively developing some mod. I go through a cycle of eg.
    edit graphics -> import into WAD -> test in game -> repeat. So I want to be
    able to get my updated graphics into the WAD with minimum complexity.
U3. I just want to update a single lump
U4. I have a WAD and want to add more things into it (eg. add graphics into a
    WAD that has a level.

Design ideas:
* When importing a single lump, the user usually gets prompted:

        Importing foo.gif

    Do you want to:
     (*) Replace lump named TITLEPIC?
     ( ) Update lump named FOO
     ( ) Insert a new lump named FOO

  - Some or all of these options can be missing:
    - Case U1: there is no lump to replace or update. We can only do
      I1, no prompt needed.
    - Case U2: there is likely a lump to update. If it is the same as
      the lump that's selected, there's no need to show both options.
      Maybe in this case we don't even bother to show the dialog?
    - Case U3: If selected matches name, there's no need to show both
      options. Just update or insert.
    - Case U4: Lump isn't in the WAD already, but we need to ask so that
      we can distinguish between U3/U4.

* When importing multiple lumps, the user usually gets prompted:

        Importing 5 files.

    Do you want to:
     ( ) Update lumps by filename.
     ( ) Insert a new lumps by filename.

  - If one of these options is not relevant, we don't need to prompt.
    - Case U1: there are no lumps to update. We must insert.
    - Case U2: We probably want update. But not so certain that we
      shouldn't ask? We should be consistent with the single lump case.
      Where filename doesn't match any existing lump, we must insert.
    - Case U3: N/A
    - Case U4: None of the filenames match existing lump names. In this
      case we cannot update any existing lumps, so we can just insert.

 * C1: Importing a level header copies the whole level. It's as though
       that lump being marked means that all the other level lumps are
       also marked. So if the user selects all lumps or some of them,
       as long as the header lump is marked, all are copied.
   - But, if individual level lumps are marked without the level header,
     only those level lumps are copied.

 * C2: When copying from WAD to WAD, if a lump is in a special section
       then on insert we create the section lumps too if they aren't
       present. If the destination lump already exists (ie. update not
       insert) then we do not do anything special.

== Dialog types

- Text entry
  - Rename file or lump
  - New lump (if we decide to prompt)
  - Make WAD (prompt for WAD name)
  - Make directory
- Confirm dialog
  - Delete lump
  - Delete file
  - Overwrite file
- Multiple choice prompt:
  - As above, for import/export
- Configuration dialog
