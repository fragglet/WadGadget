Different Doom engine games have different palettes, and some WADs (eg.
BTSX) use modified palettes. So we want to be able to change the palette
when working with different WADs.

General idea:
 * We have a directory ~/.config/WadGadget/Palettes containing PNG files
   containing palettes. This is the "palette database"
 * When the directory is created we create Doom.png containing the Doom
   palette
 * Palettes can be imported/exported to files or WADs
 * A symlink named default points to the default palette
 * We can override the default for particular WADs

There are two types of palette entries:
 1. Single palette.
   - This is palette #0 from PLAYPAL
   - The built-in Doom palette is just this
   - We can work with just the basic palette for most things (converting
     graphic files).
   - We cannot use this to make a PLAYPAL lump - you get an error if you
     try to copy this palette to a WAD file
 2. Multi-palette. This is the full contents of a PLAYPAL lump
   - This can be copied to a WAD as a PLAYPAL lump

More details:
 * The palette database can be brought up by pressing ^P and the parent
   directory link goes back to the previous directory
 * Copying to/from PNG file to db preserves filename
 * Copying from PLAYPAL to db renames to "foo.wad palette"
 * Copying to WAD renames to PLAYPAL
 * We can set a preferred palette for a particular WAD by copying it to
   a lump named PALPREF containing only palette #0
   - When setting preference, update the existing PALPREF lump if present
   - If there is no such lump, create a new lump at end of directory

How do we know which palette to use?
 * If the WAD contains PALPREF, use this as the palette
 * If the WAD contains PLAYPAL, use this as the palette
 * Otherwise use the default

Keys:
  Ent     View/edit palette
  ^B      Back to previous directory
  ^U  F3  Use for WAD >>>
  ^D  F4  Use as default palette
  ^C  F5  Copy / Import / Export
  ^E  F6  Rename
  ^X  F8  Delete palette
  [Probably unnecessary] ^F  F9  Export WAD / Make WAD
