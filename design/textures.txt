    - Rearrange                     s  Rearrange multiple           F2

    - Flatten to graphic            t  Flatten multiple             F9

Building block functions:

 1. Flatten texture to patch format. Should probably be the output if
    you open a texture through VFS
 2. Make subset texture dir
 3. Import and merge texture config (confirming overwrite)
 4. Patch to PNG (V_ToImageFile)
 5. PNG to SIXEL (SIXEL_DisplayImage)
 6. Texture dir to config format

Standard functions (all VFS):

 - Rearrange - F2

   Positions of textures/lumps get moved within directory

 - Rename texture - F6

   Texture name gets changed (assuming no other has the same name)

 - Delete texture - F8

   Texture(s) removed from directory

General functions:

 - View texture - Ent

   Texture gets flattened, converted to SIXEL format and shown on screen
   (1) then V_ToImageFile, then SIXEL_DisplayImage

 - Duplicate texture - F3

   Does not work with multi-select. User prompted for name of new texture;
   selected texture is duplicated.

 - Edit texture config - F4

   Open texture dir in text editor. What would occur if we didn't open
   texture lumps in VFS.

   Texture dir to config format, write to temp file, run editor, then import
   back into WAD. Exit texture view and highlight lump

 - Make new texture - F7

   New texture gets created at cursor

 - Flatten to graphic - F9

   Textures get flattened and written as new graphic lumps in same WAD.

Special functions:

 - Copy (texture -> textures) - F5

   Copy textures from one texture directory to another
   (2) from active side, convert to config format then (3) on the other side

 - Import texture config (dir -> textures) - F5

   Variation on the dir -> WAD texture config conversion, but merges into
   existing texture directory
   Just (3)

 - Export textures (textures -> dir) - F5

   Variation on the WAD -> dir texture config conversion, but only the
   marked set of textures
   (2) then convert to config format and write file

Rejected ideas:

The following are of dubious usefulness, will clutter the interface, and can be
achieved by exporting to a file and importing back in

 - Copy to new texture dir (textures -> WAD)

   Variation on "Make new texture dir" above. The destination WAD is the
   one on the other side instead.
   Create new texture directory, new lump opposite, then (3). Switch panes
   and highlight new lump

   (1), then V_ToImageFile

 - Make new texture dir

   Variation on "Copy". A new texture lump gets created but only
   containing the marked set of textures
   Create new texture directory, new lump, then (3). Exit texture view and
   highlight new lump

The following can be move to the texture editor window:

 - Copy as graphic (texture -> WAD)

   Texture(s) get flattened into patches that are copied to the other side
   Just (1)

 - Export as image file (texture -> dir)

   Texture(s) get flattened and exported as PNGs on the other side
