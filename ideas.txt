Design ideas

* Dual panes like Norton Commander
* Each pane is a WAD directory viewer but also a file browser.
  Opening a WAD is a matter of browsing to a .wad and hitting enter
* Default view is left: IWAD; right: cwd
* Different F-commands appear on bottom line of screen depending.
  (* means "only works for single lump)

      Single-lump case:          Multi-lump/file case:
* WAD / dir:
  - WAD side:
    - Left|Right (swap)          *                                 F2
    - Hexdump                    *                                 Alt-F3
    - View (Export>temp, open)   Export & open multiple            F3, Ent
    - Edit                       ? Could be: apply to multiple     F4, Alt-E
    - Export [format] (to dir)   Export multiple [format]s         F5
    - Export LMP (to dir)        Export multiple LMPs to dir       Alt-F5?
    - Rename                     ? Could be: regex rename          F6, Alt-R
    - New (empty?) lump?         *                                 F7, Ins
    - Delete                     Delete multiple LMPs              F8, Del
    - Make WAD                   New WAD containing selected lumps F9

== Old NWT commands

View Hex Dump
 - Ideally should be a full hex editor but whatever
Export RAW
 - WAD - Export LMP > Directory
Export GIF/WAV
 - WAD - Export [format] > Directory
Export >PWAD
 - WAD - Copy > WAD
 - NWT command generates a new WAD. Maybe we can just have a command that
 - makes a new empty WAD?
Import RAW >IWAD
 - Directory - Import > WAD
Show/play resource
 - Transparently export GIF/WAV/MIDI/etc. and xdg-open
 - On DOS it needs an actual viewer. Separate program?
Import RAW >PWAD
 - Convert .lmp to .wad
Import GIF/WAV > IWAD
 - Directory - Import [format] > WAD
Import GIF/WAV > PWAD
 - Convert .gif/.wav/.mid to .wad
Import GIF/WAV > RAW
 - ?
Edit Resource
 - Change field properties of graphic lumps. Generalize?
Rename Resource
 - Rename command
Textures
 - Browse to TEXTUREn lump and open like a directory
PNAMES
 - Browse to PNAMES lump and open like a directory
Setup
 - Needed?
Load WAD
 - Browse to .wad file and open
DOS Shell
 - Needed? Under DOS I guess

==

Generic decode for different lump types:

* All level lump types
* MIDI / MUS
* Graphic
* TEXTURE
* PNAMES
* Sound effect
* PC speaker effect
* PLAYPAL
* COLORMAP
* DEMO

Convert to Yocton format and back again, with basic editor in program
