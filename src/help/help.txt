Notes on copying:
 * If a WAD file is in the opposite pane, Import (F5) imports the selected file
   (or tagged files) into the WAD. The files will be converted to the WAD
   native format based on the file's name and extension (see the table below).
   New lumps are always created, even if there are already other lumps with the
   same names. The horizontal line in the opposite pane shows where they will
   be inserted.
 * Use Shift-F5 to import into a WAD file without performing any file format
   conversion (ie. ignore filename, import files as raw lumps).
 * If another directory is in the opposite pane, Copy (F5) performs a normal
   file copy. Mark multiple files to copy multiple files, otherwise the
   currently selected file is copied. You cannot copy directories.
 * If the same directory is in the opposite pane, Copy (F5) will make a duplicate
   copy of the selected file; you will be prompted to enter a name for the new
   file. You cannot do this with multiple files at the same time.
 * If a texture directory is in the opposite pane, Import config (F5) will parse
   the selected file as a deutex plain text texture file, and then insert the
   textures into the texture directory. Existing textures with the same names
   will be overwritten; any new textures will be inserted at the position
   indicated by a horizontal line in the opposite pane.
 * Make WAD (F9) creates a new .wad file in the same directory and copies the
   marked files into the .wad file. If no files are marked, an empty .wad file
   is created.

File formats when importing to a WAD (unless Shift-F5 is used):

Ctrl-A  F10       Unmark all marked lumps
Ctrl-Z            Undo last change
Ctrl-Y            Redo change

Notes on copying:
 * If a WAD file is in the opposite pane, Copy (F5) copies the selected lump
   (or tagged lumps) to the other file. The lumps will be inserted into the
   other WAD as new lumps, even if there are already lumps with the same names.
   A horizontal line in the opposite pane shows where the copied lumps will be
   inserted.
 * If a directory is in the opposite pane, Export (F5) will export those lumps
   as files into that directory. The lumps will be converted to an appropriate
   file format depending on the type of lump. See the table below for details.
 * Shift-F5 will export to files without performing any conversion (ie. .lmp
   files). You can also this function to export music tracks as .mus files
   instead of converting to .mid.
 * Files can be imported back into WAD files by switching to the opposite pane
   and using Import (F5).
 * If a patch names list is in the opposite pane, Copy names (F5) will copy the
   names of the tagged lumps into the list. This is useful if you imported some
   new patches into your WAD and need to add them to PNAMES.
 * Export as WAD (F9) will create a new .wad file in the directory in the
   opposite pane. All marked lumps will be copied into the new .wad.

File formats when exporting from a WAD (unless Shift-F5 is used):

**Texture editor**

Ctrl-V  F2        Move (rearrange) marked textures
Ctrl-]  Shift-F2  Sort marked textures into alphabetical order
Ctrl-U  F3        Duplicate selected texture
Ctrl-E  F4        Edit texture config
Ctrl-O  F5        Copy or export; see below
Ctrl-B  F6        Rename selected texture
Ctrl-K  F7        Make new texture
Ctrl-X  F8        Delete texture(s)
        Shift-F8  Delete texture(s) (no confirmation)
Ctrl-A  F10       Unmark all marked textures
Ctrl-Z            Undo last change
Ctrl-Y            Redo change

Notes on copying:
 * If another texture directory is in the opposite pane, Copy (F5) copies the
   selected texture (or marked textures) to the other directory. This can be
   used to copy texture definitions between WADs. If textures with the same
   names already exist, they will be overwritten; any new textures will be
   inserted into the other directory at the position indicated by a horizontal
   line in the opposite pane.
 * If a directory is in the opposite pane, Export config (F5) will create a
   plain text file in that directory, containing the tagged textures in the
   deutex plain text format. If no textures are tagged, the entire directory is
   exported.
 * To import such a text file back into the texture directory, switch to the
   opposite pane and use Import config (F5).
 * Texture directories go hand-in-hand with PNAMES lumps. If you add textures
   into a directory that use new PNAMES, it is important that you update the
   PNAMES lump when prompted.

**PNAMES editor**

Ctrl-V  F2        Move (rearrange) marked patch names
Ctrl-]  Shift-F2  Sort marked names into alphabetical order
Ctrl-E  F4        Edit plain text config file
Ctrl-O  F5        Copy or export; see below
Ctrl-B  F6        Rename selected patch name
Ctrl-K  F7        Add new patch name
Ctrl-X  F8        Delete patch names(s)
        Shift-F8  Delete patch names(s) (no confirmation)
Ctrl-A  F10       Unmark all marked patch names
Ctrl-Z            Undo last change
Ctrl-Y            Redo change

Notes on copying:
 * If another patch names list is in the opposite pane, Copy names (F5) will
   add the selected name (or tagged names) into the other list. Duplicate
   names will not be added.
 * Patch names corresponding to lumps can be added to the list by opening the
   same WAD in the opposite pane, selecting the lumps and using Copy names (F5).
 * New patch names are always added to the end of the directory.
 * If a directory is in the opposite pane, Export config (F5) will create a
   plain text file in that directory that contains the tagged names, one per
   line. If none are tagged, the file will contain the entire list.
 * To import such a file into the texture directory, select the file in the
   opposite pane and use Import config (F5).
